🛡️ ImageShield: Cyber Hygiene Toolkit
ImageShield is a modular image protection app built with Streamlit. It empowers users to sanitize, watermark, and obfuscate images before sharing — with full transparency, auditability, and downloadable logs. Designed for privacy-conscious users, researchers, and demo environments.

- 📊 Summary Panel: Displays all applied protections in session
- 📘 Log Viewer: Shows timestamped actions and allows log download
- 🛠️ Settings Panel:
- Auto-run toggle
- Preview toggle
- Font size and watermark position controls
- Theme selector

🧭 Sidebar Controls
- Module Selector: Clickable buttons for CleanScan, SafeShare, and NoiseGuard
- Image Upload: Accepts .jpg, .jpeg, .png formats
- Settings: Customize watermark, noise intensity, font size, and appearance
- History Controls: Clear session state and audit logs

🧪 Requirements
Install dependencies:
pip install streamlit pillow opencv-python pandas


▶️ Run Locally
streamlit run app.py

Then open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

📸 How It Works
- 🧭 Select a module from the sidebar
- 📸 Upload an image
- 🔧 Configure settings (e.g. watermark text, noise intensity)
- 🏁 Run the module and download the protected image
- 📘 View or download the audit log

📊 Summary Panel
After running any module, the app displays:
- ✅ Module name
- ✅ Parameters used (e.g. watermark text, noise intensity)
- ✅ Download buttons for image and log

📘 Log Viewer
- Shows timestamped actions per module
- Auto-generates log.txt
- Downloadable as plain text
- Tabular view for auditability

📱 Future Roadmap
- Batch image processing
- EXIF metadata viewer/remover
- PDF summary export
- Fairness-aware filters
- Encrypted log files
- Native Android version (Kivy or Flutter)

🧠 Ideal Use Cases
- Privacy-preserving image sharing
- Research demos on fairness and robustness
- Technical competitions and hackathons
- Educational tools for cyber hygiene
